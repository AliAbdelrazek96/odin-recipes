                <li> Assemble the casserole: Layer half of
                     the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. 
                    Season. Layer onion slices over top, then top 
                    with remaining potatoes. Season again.</li>
                <li>Make the sauce: Melt the butter in a saucepan. 
                    Gradually whisk in flour and salt and cook for about 1 minute.
                     Gradually whisk in the milk. Cook, whisking constantly, 
                    until the mixture has thickened. Stir in the cheese.</li>
                <li> Bake the casserole: Pour the sauce 
                    over the potatoes. Cover the dish with foil and 
                    bake in the preheated oven until 
                    the potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbling.
